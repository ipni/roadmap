# Project Goals

## What an impactful IPNI looks like

1. Reliable & Conceptually Simple
  a. The abstraction of a 'key value store' just works, without additional thought having to be put in by the publisher/consumer. Key Value operations (reads and writes) work with a 5-nines (99.999%) success rate.
2. Nearby
  a. There is a federated instance in the region of any given client, such that queries are reliably answered within ~50ms
3. Up-front expectations
  a. Publishers / partners understand the community-level limits (TBD ingest latency, daily publishing rate), and how they can get further service through payments. The payment amounts are reasonable for the service provided.
    1. We can explain our pricing model (e.g. a premium tier once you hit n MB / m items per day, or for stronger SLAs)
4. Decentralized
  a. The operations do not depend on a single entity; there is a functional governance/coordination process;
5. Responsive
  a. As new use cases are identified, the system is able to evolve quickly meet additional requirements
